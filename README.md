# LAFF-On-PfHP
Repository for "LAFF-On Programming for High Performance"

This repository holds the exercises related to the Massive Open Online
Course "Programming for High Performance" to be offered on the edX
platform.

Most of the materials can already be accessed by visiting
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/flame/laff/pfhp/LAFF-On-PfHP.html.
That PreTeXt generated book will eventually be distributed via
http://ulaff.net.

## Own work
This is my own work during the course **LAFF-On_PfHP**. The code contains
only the modifications needed in order to do the homework exercises.
The jupyter notebooks are only my personal notes, and are totally based on
the distributed PreText book linked above.
All rights go to the course staff.
